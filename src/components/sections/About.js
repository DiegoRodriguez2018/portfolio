      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm an experienced Android Mobile Application Developer that enjoys
        finding creative ways to solve complex problems and improving processes.
        I enjoy getting things done and creating great user experiences. Iâ€™m
        able to contribute effectively to iOS codebases and my experience also
        includes web and back-end development with JavaScript/TypeScript
        frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last few years, I have contributed to building engaging features
        used by millions of people daily. This was done following
        enterprise-grade design patterns and always keeping scalability,
        testability and monitoring in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early in my career, I also got exposure to diverse sectors, including
        Mechanical Engineering, Manufacturing, Environmental Science and Higher
        Education. I also have interest in a range of tech fields like AI, Data
        Science and 3d Modelling, which I explore in my spare time.
